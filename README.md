# Pokémon Orange

This is a ROM hack of Pokémon Crystal.

To patch the ROM, apply [**movie-2000-pss.ips**](patches/movie-2000-pss.ips) or [**movie-2000-no-pss.ips**](patches/movie-2000-no-pss.ips) to a clean Pokemon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.0) [C][!].gbc ROM. (This is no longer recommended, see below)

For the latest version (recommended, but may have unknown bugs), download the latest nightly build from [**the releases tab**](https://github.com/PiaCarrot/pokeorange/releases/tag/beta-nightly).

To build the ROM yourself, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).

This hack is **not** complete. The latest build goes up to the Champion fight, with a postgame event based on Movie 2000. 

There will be bugs, please report any that you find over in the Discord server (to make things easier for everyone, please do a quick search to check if anyone else has reported that bug already!)
